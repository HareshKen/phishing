## 🔧 Configuration

### Settings Available
- **Real-time Protection**: Enable/disable automatic URL scanning
- **Warning Notifications**: Show browser notifications for threats
- **Auto-block Phishing**: Automatically block high-risk sites

### Accessing Settings
1. Click the extension icon in the toolbar

3. Settings are automatically saved and synced across devices

## 🧠 How It Works

### ML-Powered Detection
The extension uses a sophisticated multi-model approach:

1. **Feature Extraction** (50+ features):
   - URL length, domain structure, path analysis
   - Character distribution and entropy calculations
   - Keyword pattern matching
   - TLD risk assessment
   - Brand impersonation detection

2. **Ensemble Prediction**:
   - Random Forest simulation (structure-focused)
   - XGBoost simulation (pattern-focused)
   - LightGBM simulation (content-focused)
   - Weighted voting for final decision

3. **Risk Scoring**:
   - Low risk: 0-10 points (Legitimate)
   - Medium risk: 10-35 points (Suspicious)
   - High risk: 35+ points (Phishing)

### Real-time Analysis
- URLs are analyzed when pages load
- Results are cached to improve performance
- Badge and notifications provide instant feedback

## 🛡️ Security Features

- ✅ Domain spoofing (e.g., g00gle.com instead of google.com)
- ✅ Suspicious TLDs (.tk, .ml, .ga, .cf, etc.)
- ✅ IP address usage instead of domain names
- ✅ URL shortener analysis
- ✅ Excessive subdomains
- ✅ High entropy (random) domain names
- ✅ Phishing keyword detection

### Brand Protection
- ✅ Major brand impersonation (Apple, Google, PayPal, etc.)
- ✅ Banking and financial service spoofing
- ✅ Social media platform mimicking
- ✅ E-commerce site impersonation

### User Protection
- ✅ Form submission warnings on suspicious sites
